# CSS Animation Practice

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of CSS animations I've created to practice and enhance my understanding of CSS animations. Each animation is designed to demonstrate different techniques and properties of CSS animations.

## Technologies Used
This project uses:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling and creating animations using CSS3 properties like keyframes, transitions, and transforms.

## How to Use
To view the animations, follow these steps:
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Each animation is contained within its own HTML file or section for easy viewing.
